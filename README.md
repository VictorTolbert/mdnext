## Templates

MDNEXT itself is a collection of opinionated templates, focused on getting you up and running quickly with your NextJS + MDX based projects. Local content blogs, CMS powered solutions, and ecommerce ready sites all built around awesome tools from our ecosystem. These tools include:

- Different styling approaches
- Opinions for sourcing MDX
- Media optimization + management

& much more!

While these opinions may come installed, you are able to plug and play with your favorite tools as you see fit.
If you find yourself building out a project you think might be a useful template, definitely submit your project!

Currently supported templates:

- [mdnext-starter](https://github.com/domitriusclark/mdnext-starter) - This is the starter used to create new templates. This comes with a very minimal setup strictly for handling MDX with Next.

- [mdnext-blog](https://github.com/domitriusclark/mdnext-blog) -
  A blog based project that lays the ground work on how to handle MDX locally w/ an easy transition into remote data.This comes pre-configured with Chakra-UI for your styles and Cloudinary for all your media handling!
