## Templates

MDNEXT itself is a collection of opinionated templates, focused on getting you up and running quickly with your NextJS + MDX based projects. Local content blogs, CMS powered solutions, and ecommerce ready sites all built around awesome tools from our ecosystem. These tools help with:

- Styling
- Handling MDX and how to source it
- Media handling + optimization
- && a lot more awesome integrations to come 

While these opinions may come installed, you are able to plug and play with your favorite tools as you see fit.
If you find yourself building out a project you think might be a useful template, definitely submit your project!

Current templates:
- [mdnext-blog](https://github.com/domitriusclark/mdnext-blog) -
A blog based project that lays the ground work on how to handle MDX locally w/ an easy transition into remote data. 

- [mdnext-graphcms](https://github.com/domitriusclark/mdnext-graphcms) -
Utilizing [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com) as a datasource for our blog posts, gives an example of how you'd pull markdown from the CMS and use it in your Next project.
